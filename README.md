# SoundAnalysis

This is a test project to make C++ software that opens/saves sound files (.wav) and analyzes sound structures.

## Prerequisites

### Softwares

 - Qt (Qt 5.7.0 (MSVC 2013, 32 bit))
 - FFTW (fftw-3.3.5-dll32) (QWidgetWAVChart.cpp includes it)

Folders should be set up in the parent's parent directory.

### Installing

Maybe I should prepare CMake. 

```
but I am not quite sure how to do that properly
```

I am using windows Qt Creator (MinGW 32bit) to build.
